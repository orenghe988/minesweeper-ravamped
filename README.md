### ‚ùóIMPORTANT: This started as a school project where not using any external libraries was a requirement

### This project will be reworked to take advantage of modern libraries

---

### **A complete rework** of the old-layout minesweeper, with a refreshed look and feel, and two brand new game modes

- **Fences mode (PENDING):** Grants players the ability to craft a limited number of fences around game squares, in order to isolate an area on the board that might be a source to an explosion (As a result of the player clicking on a bomb).
  This may help in situations where there is not enough information about bombs nearby, and the player has to take a risk.

- **Unstable mines mode (PENDING):** Mines now have a small chance of exploding without the player clicking on them, with 5 seconds notice -- a reaction time game. The player will have to immediately place fences in order to isolate that region of board from the rest, to save it.
